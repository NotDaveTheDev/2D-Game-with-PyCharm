# 2D-Game-with-PyCharm

I'm currently learning to code with Python following this PyCharm tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=6494s.

The goal is not so much to create the next AAA title (on one hand, C is more suitable, on the other hand, this is not what the video game market wants) but to assimilate the logic behind Python, PyCharm and video game coding.

Following this kind of tutorial gives a playful side to learning programming, which can quickly become frustrating. Once finished, I will have all the keys to code my own little programs and other 2D thingies.
